# Rasa Shipping Assistant with Twilio Voice Integration

This project integrates a Rasa chatbot with Twilio Voice for handling shipping-related queries through phone calls.

## Features

- Bilingual support (English + Arabic)
- Voice-enabled shipping status queries
- Support ticket creation through voice calls
- Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9 or higher
2. Rasa 3.x
3. Twilio account with:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - Phone number with voice capabilities

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Twilio credentials:
```env
# Twilio Credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# Rasa Configuration
RASA_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_APP=twilio_webhook.py
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Rasa server:
```bash
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

2. Start the Rasa Action server in a new terminal:
```bash
rasa run actions
```

3. Start the Twilio webhook server:
```bash
python twilio_webhook.py
```

4. Expose the webhook to the internet using ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 5001
```

## Twilio Configuration

1. In your Twilio Console, go to Phone Numbers > Manage > Active numbers
2. Click on your phone number
3. Under "Voice & Fax" section:
   - Set "A Call Comes In" webhook to: `https://your-ngrok-url/voice`
   - Method: HTTP POST

## Testing

1. Call your Twilio phone number
2. You'll hear the welcome message
3. Speak your query (e.g., "Track my shipment SHIP123456")
4. The assistant will respond with the appropriate information

## Supported Voice Commands

English:
- "Track my shipment"
- "Where is my package"
- "I want to file a complaint"
- "Report an issue with my shipment"

Arabic:
- "ÿ™ÿ™ÿ®ÿπ ÿ¥ÿ≠ŸÜÿ™Ÿä"
- "ŸàŸäŸÜ ÿ¥ÿ≠ŸÜÿ™Ÿä"
- "ÿ£ÿ±ŸäÿØ ÿ™ŸÇÿØŸäŸÖ ÿ¥ŸÉŸàŸâ"
- "ÿπŸÜÿØŸä ŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ≠ŸÜÿ©"

## Architecture

1. User calls Twilio phone number
2. Twilio converts speech to text
3. Flask webhook receives the text
4. Text is sent to Rasa for processing
5. Rasa response is converted to speech via Twilio TwiML
6. User hears the response

## Troubleshooting

1. If ngrok URL is not working:
   - Ensure ngrok is running and the URL is up-to-date in Twilio
   - Check ngrok logs for any connection issues

2. If Rasa is not responding:
   - Verify both Rasa server and Action server are running
   - Check the RASA_WEBHOOK_URL in your .env file

3. If voice recognition is poor:
   - Adjust the `speechTimeout` parameter in `twilio_webhook.py`
   - Add more speech recognition hints for your use case

## Running the Twilio Voice Webhook Server

1. Make sure your Rasa server is running on port 5005:
```bash
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

2. In a new terminal, run the Twilio webhook server:
```bash
python twilio_webhook.py
```

3. The server will start on http://localhost:5001. Use ngrok to expose this endpoint:
```bash
ngrok http 5001
```

4. Copy the ngrok HTTPS URL and configure your Twilio phone number's voice webhook:
   - Go to Twilio Console > Phone Numbers > Manage > Active numbers
   - Click on your phone number
   - Under "Voice & Fax" section:
     - Set "When a call comes in" to: Webhook
     - Set the webhook URL to: YOUR_NGROK_URL/voice
     - Set HTTP Method to: POST

The server will now:
1. Receive voice calls from Twilio
2. Convert speech to text
3. Send the text to Rasa
4. Convert Rasa's response back to speech
5. Play the response to the caller
